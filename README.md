### 💡 Examples

#### Example 1: Linear Search
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (arr[i] == key)
        return i;
}

🕒 Time Complexity: O(n)

##### Binary

while (low <= high) {
    mid = (low + high) / 2;
    if (arr[mid] == key)
        return mid;
    else if (arr[mid] < key)
        low = mid + 1;
    else
        high = mid - 1;
}
Time Complexity: O(log n)

## 🧭 Importance of Time Complexity

Time Complexity is one of the most critical aspects of algorithm analysis.

## ⚙️ Factors Affecting Space Complexity

| 🧠 Factor | 💬 Description |
|------------|----------------|
| **Input Size (n)** | Larger input requires more memory for storage and processing. |
| **Data Structures Used** | Using linked lists, trees, or hash tables increases memory consumption compared to simple arrays. |
| **Recursion** | Each recursive call consumes stack memory; deep recursion increases space usage. |
| **Temporary Variables** | Intermediate computations may require additional memory allocation. |
| **Dynamic Memory Allocation** | Excessive use of `malloc`, `new`, or similar operations can lead to high space complexity. |
| **Storage for Constants & Tables** | Lookup tables or precomputed arrays occupy additional memory. |

> ⚙️ **Example:**  
> A recursive Fibonacci implementation uses **O(n)** space due to the call stack,  
> while an iterative version can achieve **O(1)** space.
