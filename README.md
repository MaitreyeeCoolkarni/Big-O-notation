| **Storage for Constants & Tables** | Lookup tables or precomputed arrays occupy additional memory. |

> ⚙️ **Example:**  
> A recursive Fibonacci implementation uses **O(n)** space due to the call stack,  
> while an iterative version can achieve **O(1)** space.

# Strategies to Reduce Complexity

- Modularization: Break a large program or system into smaller, self-contained modules or functions for easier debugging, code reuse, and parallel development.
- Abstraction: Hide implementation details and expose only necessary functionality to simplify interaction and reduce dependencies.
- Use of Libraries and Frameworks: Leverage well-tested libraries or frameworks instead of reinventing the wheel to reduce code, minimize bugs, and improve productivity.
- Simplify Logic: Avoid overly complex conditions or nested loops; use early returns and design patterns to make code cleaner.
- Use Meaningful Names: Give variables, functions, and classes descriptive names so code is self-documenting and easier to understand.
- Limit Dependencies: Reduce coupling between modules or components using techniques like dependency injection and interface-based design.
- Comment and Document Wisely: Use comments to explain why something is done, not what is obvious, to reduce cognitive load.
- Refactor Regularly: Continuously improve code structure, remove redundancies, extract functions, and optimize loops and data structures to prevent technical debt.
- Avoid Premature Optimization: Focus on readability first and optimize later only if performance issues arise.
- Follow Coding Standards: Stick to consistent formatting, naming conventions, and structure guidelines to reduce confusion and facilitate collaboration.
